## What is UCP?

[UCP](https://ucp.dev/) is an open protocol that defines building blocks for agentic commerce—from discovering and buying to post-purchase experiences—allowing platforms, AI agents, and businesses to interoperate through one standard. Built on REST and JSON-RPC transports with MCP, A2A, and AP2 support built-in.
